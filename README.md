Hangman
=======

Adjudged 4th best in a class of 38 students, this app lets users play Hangman on the iPhone and the iPod. It supports both single player and multiplayer options. The multiplayer option lets users compete against each other by connecting devices via Bluetooth (Not supported by similar apps in the App Store when this app was created). Users can specify a category from which each device auto generates a word and sends it to the other device. The first user to correctly guess the word, wins.

###Issues:
- Works with iOS 6 but hasn't been tested for other versions.
- Has a few bugs which I haven't had time to fix.

###Disclaimer:
Some of the artwork used in this app (like the stick man) is property of Optime Software. It is used in their app (which has the same name). I didn't have time to design my own artwork so I used theirs after sending an email to the developers.
